### BWCurve.ts

Browser and Node.js compatible TypeScript library to read, write and modify Bitwig Studios .bwcurve format.
Currently, the library is written in a rather crude way. I hope to be able to gather a better understanding of the file format, maybe even Bitwigs serialization/deserialization process to improve the versatility. It is, however, functional and can already be used to convert, for example, .wav files to .bwcurve files.
